# Bioinformatics-toolkit
 A Streamlit-based toolkit for basic bioinformatics tasks, including ORF Finder, GC Content Calculator, and DNA → Protein Translator.
 The Bioinformatics Toolkit is a lightweight, beginner-friendly web app built with Streamlit. It provides essential tools for working with DNA sequences:
	•	ORF Finder – Detects Open Reading Frames on both strands.
	•	GC Content Calculator – Calculates GC %, AT %, and AT/GC ratio.
	•	DNA → Protein Translator – Translates nucleotide sequences into amino acid sequences using the standard genetic code.

This toolkit is designed for students, researchers, and hobbyists who want quick access to fundamental sequence analysis functions in a simple web interface.
