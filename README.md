# Bioinformatics-toolkit
 A Streamlit-based toolkit for basic bioinformatics tasks, including ORF Finder, GC Content Calculator, and DNA → Protein Translator.
 The Bioinformatics Toolkit is a lightweight, beginner-friendly web app built with Streamlit. It provides essential tools for working with DNA sequences:
	•	ORF Finder – Detects Open Reading Frames on both strands.
	•	GC Content Calculator – Calculates GC %, AT %, and AT/GC ratio.
	•	DNA → Protein Translator – Translates nucleotide sequences into amino acid sequences using the standard genetic code.
 	•	Codon Usage Analyzer – Calculates codon frequency and relative usage from DNA sequences (supports FASTA input).
Protein sequences:
	•	Protein Property Calculator – Computes physicochemical properties, including:
	•	Molecular Weight
	•	Aromaticity
	•	Instability Index
	•	GRAVY (hydropathicity)
	•	Extinction Coefficient


This toolkit is designed for students, researchers, and hobbyists who want quick access to fundamental sequence analysis functions in a simple web interface.
